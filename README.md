- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ndlopes-github

# About

Iâ€™m an Adjunct Professor at the Departamento de MatemÃ¡tica, Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa (ISEL), and researcher at CEMAT-ULisboa, 
where my focus is on Numerical Analysis, particularly in Computational Fluid Dynamics and Water Waves modeling.

Lately, I have been conducting research in Industrial Mathematics, collaborating with Portuguese companies and institutions through the supervision of internships and projects. My work involves mathematical modeling, computational methods, and data-driven approaches, including the application of AI techniques such as neural networks.

During my PhD, I created DOLFWAVE, a FEniCS-based library (C++ and Python) designed to solve surface water wave problems.
