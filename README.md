- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ndlopes-github

- I'm an Adjunct Professor at Departamento de MatemÃ¡tica, Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa do Instituto PolitÃ©cnico de Lisboa.
- I'm interested in Numerical Analysis focused on Computational Fluid Dynamics and Water Waves modeling. 
- More recently,  I've been developing research in some areas of Industrial Mathematics mainly through the supervision of internships and projects in collaboration with several Portuguese companies and institutions. 
- During my PhD I developed  DOLFWAVE (C++ and Python) -- a FEniCS based library for solving surface water waves problems. 
- You can see some numerical simulations using the Finite Element Method in the following youtube repository: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFvEkGMsP_IoCOwNkKcReyA/videos
